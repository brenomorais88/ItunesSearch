**# ItunesSearch App for iOS**

Welcome to the ItunesSearch app! This is a simple iOS application designed for testing purposes, showcasing the functionality to search for music using an artist's name. While the main focus is on the code implementation, the app still provides a functional interface for you to interact with.

## App Description

The primary aim of the ItunesSearch app is to demonstrate the codebase required to search for music based on an artist's name. The user interface, while functional and user-friendly, is intentionally kept minimal to emphasize the code structure and logic.

## Development Overview

- **Language:** Swift (100% Swift implementation)
- **External Repositories:** None
- **Unit Testing:** XCTest framework for unit testing
- **Running the App:** To run the app, open the "ItunesSearch.xcodeproj" file. As there are no external dependencies, there's no need to run `pod install`.

## Architecture

The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern, separating the user interface, data, and business logic components for improved maintainability and testability.

## Screen Design

The user interface is implemented using the ViewCode design approach, allowing for efficient layout rendering and easier UI adjustments.

## API Integration

The app uses the iTunes Search API (https://itunes.apple.com/) to fetch music information based on artist names. This integration enables developers to see how API requests are made and data is processed within the app.

## Future Enhancements

Given more time, the following features would be developed to enhance the app's functionality:

- **Advanced Filters:** Implement advanced filtering options to refine search results based on criteria such as genre, release date, and more.
- **Error Handling Improvements:** Enhance error handling mechanisms to provide developers with insights into handling various scenarios gracefully.
- **Infinite Scrolling:** Implement an infinite scrolling mechanism in the code to load and display more search results as the user scrolls through the list.
- **Sample Video Playback:** Enable code implementation for playback of sample videos provided by the iTunes API, offering a preview of selected tracks.
